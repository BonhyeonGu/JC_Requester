## Description

This service is an experimental tool designed to assist in testing the JenaController. When the program runs, it shuffles the order of the prepared instance RDFs, then also shuffles the sequence of queries to be applied to each RDF before executing them sequentially. The execution time recorded by JenaController is observed and aggregated.
